# Contribution Guidelines

First of all: thank you for considering contributing! Contributions are always greatly appreciated :D

To keep things organised and overall streamlined, this file contains a list of guidelines for contributing to the repository, whether it be issues or pull requests.

## Issue Submissions

As general guidance, issue submissions should follow the respective issue template for the issue type being opened -- you really can't go wrong following the template.

Additionally, please do try and search to see if an issue already exists before submitting one -- especially for things like feature changes / requests. It helps to keep things organised!

### Feature Requests

Feature requests should be submitted to the issues page, with what the change is and why it should be implemented. Note that feature requests should be within the scope of the mod -- something like requestin a new dimension is a bit out of scope!

If your feature request is determined to be in-scope, the "rfc" tag (request for comments) will be applied, requesting that others chime in on the specifics. When the specifics of a feature have been determined, the "approved" tag will be applied, signalling its status as ready for implementation.

### Feature Changes

The process for feature change requests is the same as for feature requests.

### Bug Reports

Bug reports should always be submitted, even for versions that aren't considered priority! Even if it's not a prioritised version, there is still a possibility that it is fixed, or that the bug affects a version that is.

## Submitting Pull Requests

Generally, the more information you provide with a pull request the better. A pull request with no description isn't super helpful -- after all, how is anyone supposed to know your thought process or reasoning for things?

### Bugfixes

At the very least, bugfix pull requests should give a general overview of what was done. The ideal pull request demonstrates a few things, such as:

* References a specific issue
* Specifies what has been done to fix the issue
* Indicates testing done
 * Testing doesn't have to be extensive, but more testing is always appreciated!

Not every pull request needs all of the above -- but the more of the above demonstrated, the faster your pull request is likely to be merged!

### Features

Any pull requests for features must **at least** reference an open issue requesting the feature (made prior to the submission of the pull request), and ideally references an issue with the "approved" tag. Pull requests that do the latter are more likely to be merged in more quickly!

This is not intended as a slight against anyone's ideas -- they're likely great! This is more to have a specific, orderly process in place for new features.

### Translations

Truthfully, there's not much guidance here at the moment. Just specify the language translated, and submit the pull request!
