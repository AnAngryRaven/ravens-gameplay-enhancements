## Update Schedule / Backport Policy

Despite this mod's relative simplicity, maintaining it for every single version of the game is not something that I can guarantee; Instead, development priority will go towards both the most recent version of the game to have released, and any versions considered to be "LTS" (Long-Term Support). Bugfixes *may* still be applied to other versions, depending on severity, complexity, and how much time I have free.

The LTS will have all the features of the newest version, with exception to features that are unique to the newest version.

In summary, the priority is as follows:

1. Porting to new versions
2. Developing for LTS / newest version
3. Bugfixing other versions
4. Porting features to other versions

Note that submitting a PR with a bugfix (especially one that has been tested already) *is* relatively likely to be merged in.
